## Physical Layer :

### ① Modulation Scheme ↔ NRZ (non-return to zeroes)

*   To send data, sender and receiver clocks should be sync-ed.
*   Instead of sending clock as well, make data change frequently which acts as a synchronizer.

| Data    | NRZ          | NRZI         |
| :------ | :----------- | :----------- |
| 01101   | signal charge w/ clak | signal charge w/ |

(Bent through NRZI)

**4B5B encoding**

converts 4 bits of data to "frequently changing" 5 bits of data.

max 3 consecutive 0s

### ② Max Data Rate of channel:

*   **Nyquist Sampling for noiseless channels**

    MDR = $\frac{2 \cdot B \cdot \log_2 V}{I}$

    V = 2 \[Binary 0/1]
    = 4 \[QPSK]

    $B$ = Bandwidth

    levels (modulation) of signal

*   **Shannon channel capacity for noisy channels**

    MDR = $B \cdot \log_2 (1 + \frac{S}{N})$

    $$
    SNR = (\frac{S}{N}) = 10 \log_{10} (\frac{S}{N}) \text{dB}
    $$

    { Signal-to-
    noise
    ratio }

    Signal-to-
    noise ratio
    = [SNR]

### ③ Delay in transmission:

*   **Transmission delay** → from bit in computer to transmission link

    Packet size: L bits
    Data rate: R bits/sec

    } $d_{trans} = L/R$

*   **Propagation delay** → physical distance to be travelled

    length of wire: m metres
    speed of data transmission: c metres/sec

    } $d_{prop} = m/c$

*   **Processing delay** → processing data delay by receiver

*   **Queue delay** → queueing of data due to output channel being slower en transmission than input channel.
